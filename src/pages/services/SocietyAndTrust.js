              <h3>üîç Understanding NGO Registration in India</h3>
              <p>
                An NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) is a non-profit body formed to promote social, charitable, religious, educational, or cultural causes. NGOs play a vital role in supplementing government welfare programs and driving social development.
              </p>
              <p>In India, NGOs can be registered under three main legal frameworks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Charitable Trust</strong> ‚Äî Under the Indian Trusts Act or State Trust Acts</li>
                <li><strong>Society</strong> ‚Äî Under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (as adapted by states)</li>
                <li><strong>Section 8 Company</strong> ‚Äî Under the Companies Act, 2013</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each form has its advantages and legal implications. Mundra Legal helps clients choose the best structure based on their objectives, governance needs, and future funding or compliance goals.
